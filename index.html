        <h2>The Consequences of Inbreeding and Extreme Breeding Practices</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes,</p>

        <h2>What is the current problem CheckaPet is trying to solve?</h2>
        <p>Years of inbreeding and breeding for appearance have caused high rates of inherited diseases in purebred dogs, and to a lesser extent, cats. Breeding for extreme looks has led to many dogs suffering from painful conditions like skin infections, heart disease, joint pain, and breathing problems, which affect their quality of life. Some breeds, like the French Bulldog, now face significantly reduced life expectancy, with an average of just 4.5 years.</p>

        <h2>What are the issues?</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes,</p>

        <h3>Genetic Health Risks</h3>
        <p>Some breeds have severe genetic diseases that can cause suffering, making breeding them in their current state questionable.</p>

        <h3>Breeding Challenges</h3>
        <p>Dog breeds have limited gene pools. Efforts to eliminate one disease may increase another, making careful breeding complex and costly.</p>

        <h3>Cost of Health Testing</h3>
        <p>Health tests for breeding dogs can be expensive, but skipping them may lead to high vet costs for preventable diseases in the future.</p>

        <h3>Outcrossing & Legal Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Outcrossing (breeding with other breeds) could improve health, but kennel clubs often resist it. Breeders are legally responsible for producing healthy dogs under UK law.</p>

        <h2>How do I choose a family dog or cat?</h2>
        <p>Health testing is not the golden bullet to solve these problems but it is a step in the right direction. Having a clear idea of what a moderate looking healthy dog looks like, is a good place to start. Dogs should not have overly long backs, very short legs, a squashed face or multiple, thick folds of skin. A dog should be able to breathe silently, sleep peacefully, run energetically and have a positive, friendly disposition to be a family pet. This site will guide you through the process, helping with considerations and conflicts you may have.</p>

        <h2>Checkapet expectations and suggestions</h2>
        <p>All dog owners expect a long happy relationship with their pet and to support this we suggest;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a well bred dog. Breeding from healthy (health-tested), unrelated dogs with good conformation, is more likely to produce healthy puppies.</li>
            <li>Choose a breeder that has practiced preventative health care and puppy socialisation. For example, worming and vaccinations are important for both the mother and puppies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a well bred dog?</h2>
        <p>It’s relatively simple: Physical and genetic health tests for the parents, performed before breeding, to check they are themselves healthy individuals and that they don’t pass any avoidable problems onto the next generation.</p>

        <h2>How do I do this?</h2>
        <p>All breeding dogs are tested for common diseases in that breed to the best of knowledge and evidence. Make sure you have copies of these certificates.</p>

        <h2>Should cross breeds have tests?</h2>
        <p>Health testing should also be carried out when crossing between breeds, for example Labradoodles or Cockapoos. Both parents should be tested for their respective breed-related issues. This should apply to the first and subsequent generations since deleterious genes may become apparent in later generations.</p>

        <h2>Recommended documents for all puppies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A signed AWF Puppy contract</li>
            <li>Microchip registration document</li>
            <li>Temporary health insurance</li>
            <li>Vaccination certificate</li>
        </ul>
